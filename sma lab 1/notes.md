Here's a table to explain the challenges to social media analytics:

| Challenge                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| ---------------------------| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Volume and veracity of social media data | Social media generates a massive amount of data, and much of it may be irrelevant or inaccurate. This can make it difficult to extract meaningful insights from the data. Additionally, social media data can be unverified and intentionally misleading, which further complicates the analysis process. |
| Diversity of social media data (multilingual) | Social media is a global phenomenon, and it is used in many different languages. This means that social media analytics tools must be able to process data in multiple languages and account for cultural differences in the way that social media is used and interpreted. |
| Unstructuredness | Social media data is often unstructured, meaning that it does not conform to a predefined data model or format. This can make it difficult to extract insights from the data, as it may require specialized tools and techniques for analysis. Examples of unstructured data include text, images, and video. |

Note that these challenges are interrelated, and addressing one challenge may require addressing others as well. The specific challenges that an organization may face will depend on their objectives, the social media platforms they are analyzing, and the types of data they are working with.

Here's a table to explain the steps in the social media life cycle, along with some examples of tools that can be used for each step:
